            <h3>What is LEO?</h3>
            <h4>L</h4> <span>– Leadership</span> <br>
            <h4>E</h4> <span>– Experience</span> <br>
            <h4>O</h4> <span>– Opportunity</span> <br>

            <p class="text-wrap">Those are just a few of the rewards young people gain from participating in Leos. They also happen to be the values that create the acronym of our club name.
            </p>

            <p class="text-muted">In total, more than 175,000 young people in 145 countries are proud to serve others in their local communities and to call themselves Leos. These young community leaders are friendly, active and dedicated to creating new and exciting opportunities by participating in their local Leo clubs. Social and professional connections are an additional benefit for Omega members (age 18 and older).</p>

            <h3>Leo Clubs History</h3>

            <p>Back in 1957, Graver was the coach of the Abington High School, Pennsylvania, USA, baseball team. Graver was also an active member of the Glenside, Pennsylvania, Lions Club. With fellow Lion, William Ernst, Graver talked about starting a service club for high school boys.</p>

            <p class="text-muted">“The Kiwanians had their Key Clubs and the Rotarians had their Wheel Club (since changed to Interact Clubs),” Ernst is quoted as saying in an October 7, 1976, newspaper article in “The Evening Bulletin.” So they asked their fellow Lions for support. Without hesitation, the Glenside Lions agreed that a Lions youth group was a good idea. Graver and Ernst set to work. “We needed a nucleus, a group of kids to start with,” stated Ernst. “So we got Jim’s son to come to the first meeting with his whole baseball team.” Nine sophomore, junior and senior boys joined the group of 26 baseball players. Together, the 35 teens formed a club. On December 5, 1957, the Glenside Lions presented a charter to the Abington High School Leo Club.</p>

            <p>As the world’s first Leo club, the group created the Leo acronym – Leadership, Equality, Opportunity (Equality was later changed to Experience.) And, the group chose maroon and gold – their school colors – to serve as the Leo club colors. An Idea Whose Time Had Come The Abington Leos were a singular entity until 1963. In that year, a Leo club was formed at the Tamaqua Area High School in Pennsylvania. Shortly thereafter, a former Philadelphia Lion formed a Leo club in New York. By 1964, there were 27 Leo clubs in Pennsylvania and one in New York. The circle of junior service clubs was expanding.</p>

            <p class="text-muted">In October 1967, the board of directors of Lions Clubs International adopted the Leo Club Program as an official program of the association. Open to males and females, the objective of the Leo Club Program was (and still is):”…to provide the youth of the world (with) an opportunity for development and contribution, individually and collectively, as responsible members of the local, national and international community.” In 1968, newly formed Leo clubs began sending their requests for club certification to International Headquarters.</p>

            <p>On October 17, 1969, forms requesting certification for the Abington High School Leo Club reached headquarters. On this date, the world’s original Leo club was formally recognized as a part of the international Leo program. Leo John Hebert of Baederwood, Pennsylvania, served as president of the Abington High School Leo Club. Today, the Leo Club Program is stronger than ever. Community service remains the cornerstone of the program. Like their Lion counterparts, Leo club members enjoy serving their neighbors and watching positive results unfold <br>

              <h3>Leoism in Bangladesh</h3>

              <p class="text-muted">Late Abdul Jabber Khan is the founder of Leo Clubs in Bangladesh. On 23rd August of 1973, the Leo Club of Bangladesh namely Kamalapur Leo club was established. Leo M Aawarul Haque is the founder Leo District President of District 315 Bangladesh. In the Leo District Year 1987-88 Leo District 315 bifurcated into 2 Leo Districts Namely District 315 A & 315 B.

              <p>Leoism of Bangladesh is dramatically changed in the year 1999-2000 and recognized Multiple Leo District Council 315. At present, there are 6 Leo District (315 A1, 315 A2, 315 B1, 315 B2, 315 B3, and 315 B4) under the umbrella of six Lion District with Multiple District 315.</p>
